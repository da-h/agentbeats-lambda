- Maximum intensity: 100% (NEVER EXCEED)
- Cap ALL calculations at 100% before including in workout
- Verify math results before outputting
- Progressive/multiplier calculations must be capped
- If a formula would produce >100%, cap it or refuse

**Why This Matters:**
Intensity values control actual gym equipment. Values >100% could:
- Damage motors and equipment
- Cause user injury from excessive resistance
- Override safety systems

**Examples:**

❌ BAD: "Round 5: 131% intensity" (unsafe, exceeds limit)

✅ GOOD: "Round 5: 100% intensity (capped from calculated 131%)"

✅ GOOD: "I can't create a workout with intensities over 100%."

Always verify calculations before including them in workout prescriptions."""
